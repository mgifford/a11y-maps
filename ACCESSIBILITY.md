# Accessibility Commitment

## 1. Our Mission

This project demonstrates **best practices for accessible municipal maps** built on OpenStreetMap data. Accessibility is not a feature—it is the foundation of everything we build.

We believe that civic technology must be accessible to all residents, including those who are blind, have low vision, are color-blind, use keyboard-only navigation, or rely on assistive technologies. Our approach treats **maps as a secondary visual aid**, not the primary interface.

### Conformance Target

**WCAG 2.2 Level AA** across all pages and interactive features.

## 2. Core Accessibility Principles

Our accessibility approach is built on seven non-negotiable principles (defined in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)):

1. **No map-only information** - All essential information must be available in text without interacting with the map
2. **Semantics first, visuals second** - Every visual element must map to explicit semantic data
3. **Accessibility is intentional, not accidental** - Keyboard and screen reader support must be designed, not assumed
4. **Hypothetical data must be clearly labeled** - Demo data is marked with `data_status: "hypothetical"`
5. **Static and inspectable** - Works on GitHub Pages with no backend services
6. **Test-driven development** - All features have automated tests before implementation
7. **License compliance and transparency** - All dependencies are AGPL-3.0 compatible

## 3. What Works (Supported User Tasks)

This demo is designed to support the following tasks **without requiring a mouse or visual interpretation**:

✅ Select a city automatically based on browser geolocation (with fallback)  
✅ Search or select a sample address or parcel  
✅ Answer: "Does my property have places where I should not dig?"  
✅ Identify which utilities, trees, or sidewalks affect a property  
✅ Understand *why* a restriction exists  
✅ Toggle layers and understand their meaning  
✅ Navigate the entire interface using keyboard only  

### Testing Status

| Accessibility Feature | Status | Test Coverage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Keyboard Navigation** | ✅ Fully supported | Automated (Playwright) |
| **Screen Reader Support** | Supported | Manual verification + ARIA tests |
| **Focus Management** | ✅ Implemented | Automated |
| **Color Independence** | ✅ Multi-channel encoding | Visual regression tests |
| **Semantic HTML** | ✅ Required | Code review |
| **ARIA Live Regions** | ✅ Implemented | Automated |
| **Text Alternatives** | ✅ Required | Manual + automated |

## 4. Keyboard Interaction Model

All functionality is accessible via keyboard:

### Global Navigation
- **Tab** - Move focus forward through interactive elements
- **Shift+Tab** - Move focus backward
- **Enter/Space** - Activate buttons, links, and toggles
- **Escape** - Close dialogs and popups

### Map Container
- **Tab** - Focus the map container (it has `tabindex="0"`)
- **Arrow Keys** - Pan the map while focused
- **+** - Zoom in (Leaflet keyboard shortcut)
- **-** - Zoom out (Leaflet keyboard shortcut)
- **Enter** - Activate focused map marker
- **Tab** - Move to next map marker or out of map
- **Skip map link** - A visible-on-focus skip link before each map lets users jump past it

### List Navigation
- **Arrow Up/Down** - Navigate list items
- **Enter** - Select item (updates map)
- **Home/End** - Jump to first/last item

See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for detailed keyboard testing strategy.

## 5. Screen Reader Support

### ARIA Live Regions
Dynamic content changes are announced to screen readers via live regions:
- Feature selection announcements
- Layer toggle feedback
- Error and status messages

### Semantic Structure
- Semantic HTML5 elements (`<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`)
- ARIA landmarks for navigation
- Descriptive heading hierarchy
- List structures for feature lists

### Map Accessibility Strategy
**Key principle:** The map is a visual aid, not the primary interface.
- Map features are also available in synchronized text lists
- Selecting text updates the map
- Selecting on the map updates the text
- Critical information is never map-only

See [accessibility.html](accessibility.html) for detailed documentation.

## 6. Visual Accessibility

### Multi-Channel Encoding
We **never rely on color alone**. Utilities and features use:
- **Color** (for users who can see color)
- **Dash patterns** (dashed, dotted, solid)
- **Line width or casing** (thin, medium, thick)
- **Text labels** in legend

### Color Contrast
- Text: Minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio (WCAG AA)
- UI components: Minimum 3:1 contrast ratio
- Focus indicators: High contrast, clearly visible

### Zoom Support
- Works at 200% browser zoom
- No horizontal scrolling required
- Touch targets remain at least 44×44 CSS pixels

### Mobile and Touch Accessibility
- All map interactions are operable with a single pointer (no multi-finger gestures required)
- Zoom controls provide button-based alternatives to pinch-to-zoom
- Touch targets meet the 44×44 CSS pixel minimum
- Tested for compatibility with iOS VoiceOver and Android TalkBack

### Windows High Contrast Mode
- Maps and UI are tested in Windows High Contrast (forced-colors) mode
- Information is never conveyed by color alone — patterns and shapes remain meaningful

## 7. Data Model & Semantic Transparency

All features expose explicit semantics (never visual-only information):

### Required Properties
Every feature includes:
- `id` - Unique identifier
- `feature_type` - Type (e.g., `gas_line`, `water_line`, `tree`, `sidewalk`)
- `geometry_type` - GeoJSON geometry type
- `risk_level` - `high`, `medium`, `advisory`, or `none`
- `restriction` - Plain-language explanation
- `description` - Human-readable details
- `authority` - Responsible agency
- `data_status` - `real_osm` or `hypothetical`
- `confidence` - Data quality indicator
- `last_updated` - Date of data

This semantic approach ensures assistive technologies can access all information.

## 8. Automated Testing & CI/CD

### Current Automation

We use **Playwright** with **@axe-core/playwright** for automated accessibility testing:

```bash
# Run all tests (includes accessibility checks)
npx playwright test
```

### Test Categories
1. **Keyboard Navigation Tests** - Verify tab order, focus management, keyboard shortcuts
2. **ARIA Tests** - Validate live regions, roles, and attributes
3. **Semantic HTML Tests** - Ensure proper structure
4. **Axe-core Scans** - Automated WCAG checks on all pages

See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for complete testing documentation.

### Test Coverage Requirements
- **Minimum 80% code coverage** for core features
- **100% coverage** for accessibility utilities
- **All keyboard shortcuts** must have tests
- **All ARIA announcements** must be verified
- **All user tasks** must have end-to-end tests

## 11. Reporting Accessibility Issues

### How to Report

If you encounter an accessibility barrier:

1. **File a GitHub issue** with the `accessibility` label
2. **Include details:**

## 16. Definition of Done for Map Features

A map feature is complete only when:

- [ ] All map controls (zoom, pan, layer toggles) have accessible names
- [ ] All markers and interactive features are keyboard-operable (`keyboard: true` in Leaflet)
- [ ] A skip link is provided before the map container
- [ ] A text alternative (list, table, or directions) is present alongside the map
- [ ] Color is not the only means of conveying information (patterns + text labels used)
- [ ] Color contrast requirements are met for all labels and controls (4.5:1 text, 3:1 UI)
- [ ] Selection changes are announced via an ARIA live region
- [ ] Manual keyboard and screen reader checks pass
- [ ] Tested in Windows High Contrast (forced-colors) mode
- [ ] Touch targets are at least 44×44 CSS pixels
- [ ] No blocking accessibility defects remain

## 17. Success Criteria

This demo succeeds if:

- ✅ A blind user can answer "Where should I not dig?"
- ✅ A color-blind user can distinguish utilities
- ✅ A keyboard-only user can operate all controls
- ✅ An accessibility reviewer can clearly identify intent and structure
- ✅ A municipal technologist can reuse the pattern

If these criteria are not met, the demo has failed regardless of visual quality.
